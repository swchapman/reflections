When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you either want an easy way to share the repository with people or if you need to work on your project from multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  If Git automatically stayed up-to-date with your remote repository, it could undo any changes you were working on that hadn't been committed yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Fork: A clone between two repositories on GitHub. Usefule when you want your work on a project to not alter the original repository.
  Clone: A clone of another repository on the same or different system. Useful when you want to work on a project without affecting the original repository.
  Branch: A variation of the main project that needs to be worked independently of the main project, but may someday be incorporated into the main project (i.e. adding a feature)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It allows you to have a backup of the project, and it also lets you start new modifications from a known point.
