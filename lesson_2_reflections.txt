What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Git creates a repository in the directory from which you've run the command.  This is necessary because git will now track changes (via commits) to all files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is an intermediary location for changes or additions to a repository.  It allows a user to leave out extraneous files or fix typos prior to committing them to the project.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  Never update more than one file at a time, or make a commit for each logical change per file, annotating the reason for the commit each time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

  If you are adding a feature to a project, you could have a version that does contain the feature and one that doesn't, or if you are using the same project for different people who require only cosmetic changes, then branches could help keep those changes organized.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  The branches help you figure out where your branch skewed from the master, so you'll be able to see what changes have occurred to master that don't apply to your branch, or see any other branches that might exist and how their changes apply.
